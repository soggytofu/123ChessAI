# Chess AI Implementation Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview


This is my chess AI implementation. If you read this so far, it currently doesn't move.
It utilizes an evaluate board with the basic board to see which spaces are good or bad,
and its better than random. Just having issues with the moving part, but hopefully it
will work soon.

Thanks for listening
